## Decision 1: LLM Model Selection

**Decision**: Default model profile is `light`, backed by `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash`. LLM parameters (model, temperature, top_p, max_tokens) are configured as named profiles under the `llm.profiles` section in `~/.milai/config.yaml`, with `llm.default_profile` selecting the fallback profile. State config may reference an LLM profile by name under `states.<state>.llm`, so user-facing conversational states can use a stronger model than structured content-generation states. API keys remain in environment variables exclusively (secrets must not be written to files).

**Rationale**:

The application's LLM requirements are specific and differ markedly from what most "latest" frontier models are optimised for:

| Requirement | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Strong multilingual coverage | The core value proposition — must handle 30+ languages including non-European ones |
| Instruction following & structured JSON output | Every call returns a structured response; reliability matters more than reasoning depth |
| Low cost per token | Multiple LLM calls per session (assessment questions, lesson generation, exercise feedback, deviations); cost compounds |
| Fast time-to-first-token | TUI responsiveness depends on it |
| Does NOT need: complex reasoning, code generation, agentic tool use | These are the primary training objectives of most frontier "coding" models |

Models evaluated:

| Model | Multilingual | Cost (input/output per MTok) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash` | Excellent — Google's web-scale multilingual corpus | ~$0.10 / $0.40 | **Selected default**: Flash tier designed for efficiency, not deep reasoning; native structured JSON output; strong for 100+ languages |
| `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | Strong — 50+ languages well-covered | ~$0.15 / $0.60 | Good alternative; solid instruction following; weaker on rare languages |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` | Good — English-dominant training | ~$0.80 / $4.00 | More expensive; Anthropic's multilingual data is narrower than Google's |
| `openai/gpt-4o` / `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | Excellent | $2–15 / MTok | Overkill; trained to excel at tasks we don't need; no cost justification |
| `mistral/mistral-small` | Good European languages, weak on Asian/rare | <$0.10 / MTok | Cheapest option; quality drops significantly for non-European languages |

**Why not the latest frontier model**: Frontier models (Opus, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) are primarily trained and RLHF'd on coding, agent orchestration, and complex multi-step reasoning. These capabilities are irrelevant for generating pedagogically sound language exercises. The marginal quality gain does not justify a 5–15× cost increase per session.

**Why Gemini 2.0 Flash specifically**: Google's training corpus includes the multilingual web at a scale no other provider matches (Google Translate, Search, YouTube subtitles across 100+ languages). The Flash tier is explicitly designed for high-throughput, low-latency tasks — exactly our structured content-generation pattern. Structured JSON output is reliable. For rare target languages (e.g., Swahili, Welsh, Tagalog), Gemini's multilingual coverage is materially better than alternatives.

**Important qualification**: Free-form user-facing conversation has a different failure mode than theory/exercise generation. In deviation mode, the model must maintain tone, answer ambiguous learner questions, adapt explanations, and recover conversationally when the learner is confused. `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash` is a good default for structured assessment, curriculum, lesson, and feedback calls, but it may be too weak as the default for open-ended learner conversation. The architecture should therefore support routing conversational states to a stronger configured model without forcing all structured calls onto the expensive model.

**Configuration**:

LLM parameters are split by concern:

| Setting | Source | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `llm.profiles.<profile>.*` | `~/.milai/config.yaml` | Non-secret named model profiles; user can tune a shared model choice in one place |
| `llm.default_profile` | `~/.milai/config.yaml` | Global fallback profile for states that do not choose one |
| `states.<state>.llm` | `~/.milai/config.yaml` | Optional per-state profile reference without coupling all state behavior to the LLM config section |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Environment variables | Secrets must never be written to files |

`~/.milai/config.yaml` default:
```yaml
llm:
  default_profile: light
  profiles:
    light:
      model: gemini/gemini-2.0-flash
      temperature: 0.7
      top_p: 0.95
      max_tokens: 1024
states: {}
```

Optional stronger model for user-facing conversation:

```yaml
llm:
  default_profile: light
  profiles:
    light:
      model: gemini/gemini-2.0-flash
      temperature: 0.7
      top_p: 0.95
      max_tokens: 1024
    heavy:
      model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
      temperature: 0.8
      top_p: 0.95
      max_tokens: 1536

states:
  deviation:
    llm: heavy
```

The initial v1 default config leaves `states` empty to keep setup simple. Recommended documented override: route `deviation` to a stronger conversational model profile when users notice shallow or brittle answers. State `llm` values must reference a key in `llm.profiles`; invalid profile names fail config validation at startup.

Config is loaded once at startup into a `Config` dataclass containing `llm: LLMProfilesConfig` and `states: dict[str, StateConfig]`. Missing file = use defaults. Missing keys = use per-key defaults. `StateConfig` initially contains only `llm: str | None`, but it is the intended place for future state-specific knobs such as deviation turn limits, retry behavior, or review thresholds.

The config loader validates profile references at startup. The entrypoint constructs one `LiteLLMClient` per configured profile, each with a single resolved `LLMConfig`. When constructing each state handler, the entrypoint chooses the handler's profile from `states.<state>.llm` or falls back to `llm.default_profile`, then passes the corresponding client into that handler's constructor. This keeps `LLMClient` unaware of app states, profile names, and routing tables while still allowing state-scoped model selection. The client does not read files or env vars directly (follows Principle V). Any LiteLLM-compatible model string is valid.

**Alternatives considered**: FSRS-style model-specific fine-tuning was considered but rejected (out of scope; LLM is the content engine, not a classifier).

## Decision 2: Workflow Architecture — State Machine

**Decision**: Hand-rolled state machine with `AppState` as a discriminated union of state variants, each carrying its own payload. One constructor-wired handler class per state. No external state machine library.

**Evaluation of alternatives**:

The user asked to evaluate this against alternatives. Here is the full analysis:

**Option A — Sequential async generator / coroutine chain**

The app flow could be expressed as a linear coroutine: `onboarding() → assessment() → curriculum_review() → learning_loop()`. Each function yields control to the next.

Problems:
- Resuming mid-flow requires reconstructing coroutine call stack from persisted state — not straightforward
- DEVIATION sub-state (free conversation during a lesson) requires suspending the lesson mid-exercise and re-entering it, which is awkward in a linear chain
- LLM failure retry (FR-013) at an arbitrary point in the chain requires exception propagation back to the right level
- Adding a new state (e.g., `ASSESSMENT_OVERRIDE`) requires modifying function signatures in the middle of the chain

**Option B — Event-driven message bus**

Each user action publishes an event; handlers subscribe. Decoupled but:
- Over-engineered for a linear flow with limited branching — YAGNI violation
- State is implicit (must be inferred from accumulated events)
- Resume from checkpoint requires event replay, which is complex

**Option C — State machine with discriminated union (selected)**

Each `AppState` variant maps to a handler class with a `step()` coroutine. The machine holds `AppState` and `UserState` as independent structures — `AppState` is workflow state (where we are + transient context); `UserState` is domain data (what the user knows). Transition = replace `AppState` with the new variant. Persistence = serialise both separately under two top-level keys in `state.json`.

Handler instances are composed at startup. Each handler receives only the dependencies it needs, typically `IOMediator`, the `LLMClient` selected for that state, and optionally that state's `StateConfig`. A handler does not load config, resolve model profiles, import LiteLLM, or save state.

Benefits:
- **Resume is trivial**: deserialise `AppState` + `UserState`, dispatch handler for the current variant
- **LLM retry is local**: each handler catches `LLMError`, shows retry prompt, loops — no re-entry complexity
- **DEVIATION carries its own payload**: `DeviationState` holds the context window directly — no separate nullable field, no risk of the buffer persisting outside DEVIATION
- **New states are additive**: add a union variant + handler class + dispatch branch + startup wiring
- **Testable in isolation**: instantiate a handler with fake `IOMediator` and fake `LLMClient`, then call `step(state, user)`
- **`UserState` stays clean**: no workflow fields contaminate the domain model
- **LLM routing stays simple**: profile selection happens once in `main.py`, not inside the LLM client or at every call site

**Verdict**: State machine is correct. The user's intuition is validated by the resume and deviation requirements, both of which are genuinely difficult in alternatives.

**Dispatch mechanism**: `match/case` in `machine.py`. Each `case StateVariant():` branch calls the corresponding handler instance, e.g. `handlers.deviation.step(app, user)`, and narrows the type for `ty` — no casts needed. The full graph topology is visible in one readable dispatch function.

**Handler class guardrails**:

- `AppState` and `UserState` models remain pure Pydantic data; they do not contain behavior.
- Handler classes coordinate one workflow step; they do not perform persistence or own serialization.
- `StorageClient` is used only by the machine loop, after a handler returns the next `(AppState, UserState)`.
- Prompt construction stays in `src/milai/llm/prompts/`; handlers call prompt builders rather than embedding large prompt strings.
- Concrete provider details stay in `LiteLLMClient`; handlers depend only on `LLMClient`.

**Why no library or decorator pattern** (`transitions`, `statemachine`, hand-rolled `@machine.node()`): Our state graph has 9 states. A library or decorator abstraction imposes indirection for no gain at this scale. `match/case` already gives you the explicit node list in one readable place. YAGNI applies — the hand-rolled version is ~20 lines and requires zero infrastructure.

**State variants**:

```
OnboardingState           → collect language + preferences
AssessmentState           → LLM-generated adaptive test (resumable); holds questions + cursor
AssessmentReviewState     → show fluency result; allow user override; holds pending fluency level
CurriculumGenerationState → LLM generates structured roadmap
CurriculumReviewState     → human-in-the-loop edit loop
LessonState               → sequential theory + exercises
DeviationState            → free conversation; holds context window + lesson context
LessonCompleteState       → show progress, advance cursor
CurriculumCompleteState   → show summary, offer extension
```

**Assessment topic inference boundary**:

`AssessmentQuestion` deliberately does not include `expected_topics`. Early versions considered asking the assessment prompt to label each question with the skill topics it probes, then using those labels to seed initial `Skill` records. That was rejected because per-question labels would be produced before the model has seen the learner's answers, and each generated question could name overlapping concepts differently (`travel greetings`, `greetings`, `basic greetings`, etc.). Normalizing those labels across a batch would either require brittle string rules or a second model pass, and the result would still be tied to question intent rather than demonstrated learner performance.

Instead, assessment stores only durable evidence: question text, difficulty, and the learner's answer. After the user confirms the fluency snapshot, the completed assessment questions are carried into `CurriculumGenerationState`. Curriculum generation then infers initial skill topics once, in the same pass that designs the roadmap, with access to the full answer set and the confirmed profile. This keeps topic normalization at the point where durable `Skill.topic` records are created and avoids persisting throwaway assessment labels.

## Decision 3: Local Storage Format

**Decision**: Single JSON file at `~/.milai/state.json`; atomic writes via `tempfile` + `os.replace`.

**Rationale**:

The persisted object is the entire `UserState` — a single root structure. Read/write patterns:
- **Read**: once at startup
- **Write**: after every state transition and after each exercise completion

Data volume: a full curriculum + all skills fit comfortably within a few KB. No query patterns require an indexed database.

SQLite was evaluated: it adds a dependency and ORM/schema migration complexity for a dataset that is trivially small and requires no partial queries. Overkill.

JSON with atomic writes (write to `~/.milai/state.json.tmp`, then `os.replace`) is crash-safe, human-readable (users can inspect/backup their data), and zero-dependency.

## Decision 4: Spaced Repetition Algorithm

**Decision**: Custom lightweight scheduler inspired by SM-2. Integrated into LLM prompt construction; not a separate review session.

**Rationale**:

Full SM-2 / FSRS is designed for flashcard-style review sessions with discrete recall events. Our model is different: skills are topic-level (e.g., "past tense"), not individual cards, and SRS signals feed the LLM prompt rather than driving a standalone review queue.

**Chosen algorithm** (per-Skill):

```
On successful exercise for topic T:
    strength = min(1.0, strength + 0.1)
    streak += 1
    interval_days *= 2.0  (capped at 90)

On failed exercise for topic T:
    strength = max(0.0, strength - 0.2)
    streak = 0
    interval_days = 1.0

due_for_review(skill) = (today - last_seen).days >= interval_days
```

**Integration with lesson generation**: When the LLM generates exercises for a lesson, the prompt includes the top-3 skills ranked by `priority = (1 - strength) * log(days_overdue + 1)`, with explicit instructions to weave them into the exercise set alongside the new lesson topic. This blends weak-spot reinforcement into regular lessons without a separate review session.

---

## Decision 5: Context Window Management

**Decision**: Stateless per-call context. Conversational context window only in DEVIATION mode (capped at 10 exchanges).

**Per-call context budget (structured prompt)**:
1. System role prompt (~200 tokens): tutor persona + target language + teaching style
2. User skill summary (~150 tokens): top-10 skills by priority (topic, strength, last_seen only)
3. State-specific context (~300–800 tokens): current lesson/exercise or assessment answers
4. User message (~50–200 tokens)

Total typical prompt: ~700–1200 tokens. Response: ~300–600 tokens. Per-call cost on Gemini 2.0 Flash: ~$0.0001–$0.0002. Reasonable.

**Deviation mode**: Maintains rolling window of last 10 exchanges (user + assistant). Older exchanges are dropped. On deviation exit, the context window is discarded — the lesson context is reconstructed from `UserState`.

**No cross-state context accumulation**: Each state handler builds its context fresh from `UserState`. This keeps prompts predictable, bounded, and testable.

---

## Decision 6: Sub-agents

**Decision**: No sub-agents in v1.

**Rationale**: Every LLM call in v1 is a single-turn, single-purpose request:
- Assessment question N → one call
- Curriculum generation → one call (full structured JSON)
- Lesson content → one call
- Exercise feedback → one call
- Deviation turn → one call

None of these require coordination between concurrent agents. Curriculum generation returns the full roadmap in one structured response — this is preferred over parallel module generation because it ensures narrative coherence across modules (a sub-agent approach would require a synthesis step that adds complexity and a failure mode).

Sub-agents become relevant in v2 if: (a) full curriculum generation exceeds model context limits for long curricula, or (b) parallel module refinement is needed for quality. Both are deferred.

---

## Decision 7: LiteLLM + Instructor for Structured Output

**Decision**: Use `litellm` directly with JSON mode + Pydantic validation. Add `instructor` only if provider coverage requires it.

**Rationale**: LiteLLM's `completion()` with `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` works across all major providers. Pydantic `model_validate_json()` parses and validates the response. If a provider doesn't support JSON mode reliably, `instructor` (which wraps LiteLLM and adds retry-on-parse-failure) can be dropped in at the `LLMClient` implementation layer without changing any call sites, because all call sites go through the `LLMClient` protocol.

Start with plain LiteLLM + Pydantic validation. Add `instructor` as a concrete implementation detail if parse reliability is a problem in practice.

---

## Decision 8: Handler-Owned Prompt Builders

**Decision**: Every LLM-backed state handler owns its prompt interaction contract. The actual prompt builders remain pure functions under `src/milai/llm/prompts/`, and handlers call those builders before passing the returned `list[Message]` to `LLMClient.complete()` or `LLMClient.chat()`. Structured prompt modules also own the Pydantic response models used for validation.

This deliberately does not put prompt logic on persisted `AppState` variants. `AppState` remains serializable workflow data only; handler classes are the ownership boundary for LLM calls, prompt selection, retries, and transitions.

**Prompt functions by state**:

| App state | Prompt owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AssessmentState` | `prompts.assessment` | Generate adaptive questions and derive fluency results |
| `CurriculumGenerationState` | `prompts.curriculum` | Generate the initial roadmap |
| `CurriculumReviewState` | `prompts.curriculum` | Adjust the roadmap from user feedback |
| `LessonState` | `prompts.lesson`, `prompts.feedback` | Generate lesson content, apply dynamic changes, and evaluate answers |
| `DeviationState` | `prompts.deviation` | Run bounded free-form learner conversation |
| `CurriculumCompleteState` | `prompts.curriculum` | Generate optional advanced extension modules |

`OnboardingState`, `AssessmentReviewState`, and `LessonCompleteState` use `IOMediator` only and must not call `LLMClient`.

**Rationale**:

Prompts are core product logic, not incidental strings. Keeping prompt selection handler-owned while keeping builders deterministic makes them:

- testable without network calls
- portable across the v1 TUI and future web adapter
- reviewable in code review as contracts for model behavior
- independent from provider configuration and API-key handling
- compatible with the state-specific LLM routing already chosen in Decision 1

The selected design avoids a parallel state-to-prompt registry for v1. A registry would add indirection and create a second mapping that can drift from the state-to-handler dispatch. Plain modules and functions are enough: the app maps `AppState` variants to handlers, and each handler invokes only the prompt builders it needs. Some handlers may use multiple builders (`LessonState` uses lesson generation, dynamic-change, and feedback prompts), so a single `prompt_builder` method per state variant would be too narrow.

**Alternatives considered**:

- **Prompt methods on persisted `AppState` variants**: rejected because persistence/domain models should stay pure data. Adding LLM prompt behavior there would couple serialization shape to LLM infrastructure and make state snapshots harder to reason about.
- **Inline prompt strings in handlers**: rejected because handlers would mix state transition logic, UI control flow, and prompt construction, making prompts harder to test and review.
- **Central prompt registry keyed by state name**: rejected as premature abstraction and a source of parallel-list drift; `match/case` state dispatch already provides explicit topology.
- **Provider-specific prompt adapters**: rejected because provider details belong in `LLMClient`; prompt builders must return provider-neutral `Message` values.
